# Two shared bases (D63): build fat, ship distroless. The build stage is
# discarded once the binary is copied out, so its size is not a runtime concern.
# `:latest` here is deliberate and is the point of having shared bases. Pinning a
# digest in every Containerfile would mean editing ~61 of them each time a base
# is rebuilt for a CVE — which is how bases stop being rebuilt. The base images
# are themselves built, scanned, signed and digest-pinned by the base-images
# workflow (D61, D63); this is where that indirection is spent.

# The ignore must sit IMMEDIATELY before the instruction — a comment in between
