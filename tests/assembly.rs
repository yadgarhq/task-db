//! WHICH FILES THIS DEPLOYMENT WATCHES — the half of ADR-0523's rotation
//! watcher that is this repository's own.
//!
//! The watcher's BEHAVIOUR is `yadgar-lifecycle`'s and is tested there, against
//! the atomic `..data` swap kubelet really performs: that a change ends the
//! watch, that an identical-bytes swap does not, that an unreadable mount is
//! survived, that the leaf rather than the issuer is what the gauge reports.
//! None of that is repeated here. What is here is the claim only this repository
//! can make: **an `task-db` configured this way reads exactly these files, so
//! exactly these files are watched.**
//!
//! **THE MUTANT THIS FILE EXISTS TO KILL.** The watch set is one call in
//! `main.rs`, and no test in this repository spawns the binary — so a member
//! deleted from the list would compile, pass the whole suite, and ship a process
//! that would never notice that file rotating. Every case below goes through
//! [`yadgar_task_db::rotate::watch_set`], the SAME function `main.rs` calls.
//!
//! **THREE OF THE FOUR MATERIALS ARE NOT TRANSPORT.** The database password is
//! not a certificate and the engine's CA is not one this process presents; both
//! are read once at boot out of mounts that rotate, and ADR-0523's rule is about
//! provenance rather than payload. The mounted configuration document (step 2a,
//! ADR-0569, ADR-0570) is the fourth, and it is unconditional rather than
//! `Option`-shaped like the CA — every deployment mounts it. A watch set
//! admitting only TLS files would be EMPTY in the cleartext deployment this
//! estate runs today; it no longer can be, now that the password and the
//! mounted document are both unconditional members.
//!
//! CERTIFICATES ARE MINTED PER RUN, for the reason `tests/serve_tls.rs` gives: a
//! fixture key in the repository is a secret in the repository, and it expires
//! on a date nobody is watching.
//!
//! **NO METRICS RECORDER HERE, DELIBERATELY.** The gauge NAMES belong to
//! `yadgar-lifecycle` and are asserted there. What this file needs of the leaf
//! is that the RIGHT certificate was parsed, and `Inputs::not_after` answers
//! that without a recorder — so the metric is proved by the value it would
//! carry rather than by a second dev-dependency.
