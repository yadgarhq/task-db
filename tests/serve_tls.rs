//! The serving side of the transport, proved by real handshakes.
//!
//! **A test that only shows "TLS was configured" passes against the broken
//! version of this change**, so nothing here inspects configuration. Every case
//! stands up this module's own listener through [`yadgar_task_db::boot::server`]
//! — the single function `main` builds its gRPC server with — and asks whether a
//! request survived the transport.
//!
//! THE DEFECT THIS CAR EXISTS TO REMOVE is a listener that opens in cleartext
//! because TLS configuration failed. `a_tls_listener_refuses_a_cleartext_client`
//! is the case that notices: it is the only one that fails if `server` ever
//! answers a bad identity — or a good one — with a plain `Server::builder()`.
//!
//! NEITHER AN ENGINE NOR A POOL IS INVOLVED. `boot::server` decides a transport
//! and nothing else, so these cases run with no `YADGAR_TEST_DSN` and no
//! MariaDB — unlike the suites that exercise the store.
//!
//! ALPN IS PROVED RATHER THAN ASSUMED, and by tonic's client rather than by an
//! assertion written here. `tonic::transport::Endpoint` errors when the
//! negotiated protocol is not `h2` and `assume_http2` is unset, which it is by
//! default — so a channel that connects and carries a request has negotiated
//! `h2`. The push of `h2` onto the acceptor's protocol list is tonic's own; there
//! is no line in this repository to mutate, and saying so is more honest than
//! dressing it as coverage.
//!
//! CERTIFICATES ARE MINTED PER RUN. A fixture key committed to the repository is
//! a secret committed to the repository, and it expires on a date nobody is
//! watching.
//!
//! NOTE ON `localhost`: on this machine it resolves to BOTH `::1` and
//! `127.0.0.1`, so a rig that binds one of them is flaky by construction — the
//! client picks an address the server is not on. [`serve_on_localhost`] binds
//! every address the name resolves to, on one port. That is a property of the
//! rig, not of the module.
