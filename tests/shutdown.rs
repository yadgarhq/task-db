//! What happens when Kubernetes ends this pod.
//!
//! **The bug this file exists to keep fixed:** `main` handed
//! `serve_with_shutdown` a `tokio::signal::ctrl_c()` future and nothing else, so
//! the only signal that ever reached the drain was SIGINT. Kubernetes never
//! sends SIGINT. It sends SIGTERM, waits out `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`,
//! then SIGKILLs — so on every rolling update the drain was skipped entirely.
//!
//! **IT COSTS MORE HERE THAN IN `task`, because this process holds the
//! transactions.** Nothing is corrupted: an unfinished transaction rolls back,
//! which is what D8's compare-and-set already depends on. But the caller is told
//! nothing and has to infer the outcome from a severed stream, and under D23
//! `task` reaches this module over ONE long-lived HTTP/2 connection per pod — so
//! what is severed is everything that connection was carrying.
//!
//! **THIS ASSERTS THE DRAIN, NOT THE REGISTRATION.** A test that only proved a
//! handler exists would pass against a handler wired to the wrong signal, which
//! is precisely the defect. So this runs a REAL server on a real port, sends a
//! real SIGTERM to this very process, and then asserts two things a killed
//! process could not produce: that `serve_with_incoming_shutdown` RETURNED, and
//! that the port it held stopped accepting afterwards. A process that took
//! SIGTERM's default disposition never reaches either assertion — it is gone.
//!
//! **NEITHER AN ENGINE NOR A POOL IS INVOLVED**, the same as `tests/serve_tls.rs`
//! and for the same reason: `boot::shutdown` and `boot::server` decide a
//! lifecycle and a transport, nothing more. These run with no `YADGAR_TEST_DSN`
//! and no MariaDB.
//!
//! **ONE TEST IN ITS OWN BINARY, deliberately.** A signal is delivered to a
//! PROCESS, not to a thread, and `cargo test` runs the tests within one file
//! concurrently on one process. A second test here would receive this one's
//! SIGTERM. Cargo compiles each `tests/*.rs` to its own binary, so the isolation
//! this needs is the file itself.
//!
//! **THE SIGNAL HANDLING IS `yadgar-lifecycle`'S NOW, AND THIS TEST IS STILL
//! THIS SERVICE'S.** What the crate owns is which signals are listened for and
//! when the handlers install; what is asserted here is that THIS service's
//! listener, built by `boot::server`, actually drains on one. A crate test
//! cannot make that claim — it knows nothing about tonic, this router, or this
//! port — so lifting `shutdown` does not make this redundant. It is also what
//! kills the mutant: a `yadgar_lifecycle::shutdown` that registered SIGINT alone
//! fails this file, in both `-db` repositories.
