//! What `main` decides before it opens anything — in a place a test can reach.
//!
//! `main` is a binary entry point, so nothing in it is reachable from a test.
//! That is fine for wiring and not fine for decisions, and two decisions here
//! are exactly the kind that fail silently: which transport mode the connections
//! use, and what happens to an environment key that no longer means anything.
//! Both now live in this module, and both have a test.
//!
//! **The connection options are the point.** D7's capability probe runs on a
//! connection of its own, before the pool exists. This binary used to build that
//! connection by `format!`-ing `mysql://user:pass@host:port/db`, with no
//! `ssl-mode` in it — so it inherited sqlx's default, `Preferred`, which sqlx
//! documents as falling back to an unencrypted connection when an encrypted one
//! cannot be established, while the pool beside it was on `Required`. Two code
//! paths that must agree about TLS was the bug; one path is the fix, and
//! [`probe_connect_options`] is the seam that keeps it one.
