"""THE RENDER-CHECK HARNESS: one constructed red/green pair per check the chart declares.

COPIED FROM `yadgarhq/platform`'s `scripts/tests/test_render_checks.py` AT
`origin/main`, NOT RE-DERIVED (ADR-0679). That file is the worked reference for this
construction; a matcher a sibling has hardened is copied, because the measurements
below took three rounds to get right and a second derivation gets them wrong in a
new way. What changes here is named at the bottom of this docstring and nowhere
else.

WHAT A RENDER CHECK IS FOR. A toggle GATES a resource — it says "render a MariaDB".
It does not DIAGNOSE a missing prerequisite: a toggle set true on a cluster with no
mariadb-operator renders cleanly and then fails at apply with `no matches for kind
MariaDB`, half-way through an install, naming a kind rather than an operator
somebody has to install. `templates/render-checks.yaml` turns that into a
render-time refusal that names the operator, the API group and the toggle that asked
for it.

THE TRAP, MEASURED ON helm 3.18.4 AND 4.3.0 AND NOT NEGOTIABLE, AND IT DECIDES HOW
BOTH CASES BELOW ARE CONSTRUCTED. A plain `helm template` with NO `--api-versions`
does not populate `.Capabilities.APIVersions` with CRD-backed groups at all — it
carries helm's built-in Kubernetes groups and nothing else — so
`.Capabilities.APIVersions.Has "k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1"` answers FALSE whatever the
cluster holds, and the check refuses for the RENDERER'S reason rather than for the
target's. A red case built that way cannot tell "the check works" apart from "the
renderer always answers false", which makes it no evidence at all.

SO BOTH CASES PASS `--api-versions`, AND THEY DIFFER ONLY IN WHAT IS IN IT.
Measured at the same time: `--api-versions` ADDS to helm's built-in set rather
than replacing it. THAT IS WHY THE FILLER MUST NOT BE BUILT IN: a built-in group
passed through `--api-versions` leaves `.Has` unchanged for every group, so the
render would be indistinguishable from a bare one and the red case would prove
nothing. Say `.Has` and not "changes nothing observable", because the LENGTH does
move — measured, a built-in group passed through `--api-versions` is APPENDED as a
duplicate, so `len .Capabilities.APIVersions` grows by one while `.Has` answers the
same for every group. A tripwire written on the length therefore reports a built-in
group as not built in, inverting the check it exists to protect.
`assert_the_red_group_is_not_built_in` below reads `.Has` and never the length.

THE CONSTRUCTION IS STATED OVER ALL THE CHECKS THE RENDER EXERCISES, NEVER OVER ONE
ALONE, because `fail` aborts the WHOLE chart render at the FIRST failing check and
the refusal names only that check. A red case that leaves a SECOND check unsatisfied
refuses for THAT check's reason rather than for the reason of the check under test —
the same defect one level up from the bare render refusing for the renderer's reason.
So, for a render exercising a set of checks:

  GREEN          `--api-versions` for EVERY group the render's checks ask for. It
                 must succeed and render objects.
  RED, check i   every one of those groups EXCEPT i's, PLUS the filler. It must
                 refuse, and the refusal must name check i's operator. That last
                 clause is what makes the refusal ATTRIBUTABLE to the check under
                 test, and it is the assertion a builder who meets a red suite while
                 adding a check is most tempted to delete. Deleting it is the
                 disarmament this harness exists to prevent.

THE FILLER STAYS IN THE RED CASE AT EVERY COUNT, THE ONE-CHECK CHART INCLUDED. With
one check "every group except i's" is empty, so dropping the filler collapses the red
case back into the bare render this docstring forbids. At one check the construction
reduces to the filler alone; at two or more it does not. This chart declares two, so
the clause is not load-bearing HERE today — it is kept stated because this file is
copied into charts that declare one, and because this chart may drop back to one.

THE FILLER CARRIES A TRIPWIRE ASSERTING TWO THINGS, and both run BEFORE any red case.
First, that the filler is absent from a BARE render's `.Capabilities.APIVersions`
(`assert_the_red_group_is_not_built_in`). Second, that the filler is not one of the
groups the chart's own checks ask for (`assert_the_filler_is_not_a_declared_group`) —
an obligation the generalised red case creates. A colliding filler does not pass
silently: measured, the red case for the group it collides with SUCCEEDS and renders
every object. But what goes red is that check's own red case, reported as "this red
case did not refuse", which names a symptom rather than the cause. The second
assertion names the cause, which is why it runs first.

IT ASSERTS HOW MANY PAIRS IT EXERCISED, against a number written here. The rule the
number is computed from is ONE PAIR PER RENDER CHECK THE CHART DECLARES — not per
CRD-backed kind, and not per API GROUP either, because one toggle can render several
kinds, from more than one group, behind ONE check. `templates/render-checks.yaml` is
where each check states what it guards, and the count of checks is never to be read
off the count of kinds rendered. `EXPECTED_RENDER_CHECKS` below is the one place the
number lives. Printing a count is not asserting one, and the difference is the whole
point: a harness that quietly exercises one fewer check after somebody deletes one is
the "passes having examined nothing" failure wearing a green tick.

AND THE CONSTRUCTION IS PROVED AT A COUNT THIS CHART DOES NOT CONTROL.
`test_the_construction_is_correct_at_two_checks` builds a throwaway TWO-check chart
around THIS chart's own `_require_api.tpl` and runs the SAME construction over it.
The fixture's count is `FIXTURE_RENDER_CHECKS`, which is two whatever
`EXPECTED_RENDER_CHECKS` happens to say — so the generalisation stays proved at two
on a chart declaring one, and stays proved on the next chart this file is copied into
whatever that one declares. THIS PARAGRAPH IS DELIBERATELY WRITTEN OVER NO PARTICULAR
COUNT: this file is copied into every chart that carries a render check, and a reason
stated in terms of one chart's count arrives false in the next.

WHAT DIFFERS FROM THE `platform` REFERENCE, so a reader diffing the two meets the
list rather than reconstructing it:

  - the template name is `task-db.require-api`, not `platform.require-api`. Helm
    template names are GLOBAL across a chart tree, and at the plan's step 9 the
    parent renders `platform` and the three `-db` charts in ONE namespace — one name
    shared between every chart that copies this partial is a collision that is
    invisible in each of them alone. `CHART` below is the one place the name is
    written, and the `INVOCATION` regex and the two-check fixture are both built
    from it.
  - this chart declares TWO checks, so `EXPECTED_RENDER_CHECKS` is 2.
  - there is no `example/values.yaml` here. The renders that must reach the checks
    pass `--set` for every toggle a check sits behind instead, which is `TOGGLES_ON`
    below.
  - `RECORDED_GROUP_PATHS` and
    `test_every_declared_check_names_the_group_the_values_file_records` are stated
    HERE, over every declared check. The `platform` reference asserts the same
    property one check at a time, in the suite that owns each object. Generalising it
    means a check added with no recorded path reddens on the map's coverage rather
    than on nobody noticing.
  - `test_the_checks_are_unreachable_at_the_chart_defaults` cannot assert the
    defaults render NOTHING, because this chart's defaults render a Deployment, a
    Service, a ServiceAccount and a PodDisruptionBudget. It asserts instead that
    they render no object of the checked group, and `test_mariadb.py` carries the
    count those four objects are asserted against.

    had none. A builder who deletes `+ FILLER_API_VERSIONS` from `red_api_versions`
    AND both tripwires turns every red case the CHART has into a bare render, and
    `returncode` and the stderr assertions do not notice: a bare render still exits
    non-zero, and at one declared check it still names the one operator there is. This
    case is what that builder meets instead.

    THE TRIPWIRES ARE NOT THE ONLY WITNESS AT ANY COUNT, AND THAT IS A MEASUREMENT
    RATHER THAN A CAUTION. Two other assertions redden under the SAME deletion.
    `test_the_construction_is_correct_at_two_checks` runs the same function over a
    fixture declaring TWO checks whatever the chart declares, so its `--api-versions`
    count assertion reddens at every chart count. The count assertion inside
    `exercise_one_pair_per_declared_check` is a THIRD witness, also at every chart
    count — ONE included, where a red argv that lost the filler carries zero groups
    against a `len(declared)` of one.

    MEASURED AT ONE DECLARED CHECK, on helm 3.18.4 and 4.3.0 with identical output.
    The filler, both tripwires and this case were deleted together, over a copy of this
    chart reduced to its mariadb check alone. The chart's own red case went red on
    `the red render for mariadb-operator passed --api-versions 0 times; 1 is the whole
    construction`. TWO earlier revisions of this docstring were wrong here. The first
    claimed the tripwires were the suite's only witness. The second scoped that claim
    to the chart's own red cases at one check. The count assertion refutes both.

    IT DOES NOT GO VACUOUS WHEN THE CHART LEAVES ONE CHECK, WHICH THIS ONE HAS DONE.
    Its input is the hand-written one-element set below and its expected value is a
    module-level literal — neither is the chart's count — so deleting
    `+ FILLER_API_VERSIONS` still reddens it here. The move to two checks changed
    NOTHING about which assertions witness that deletion: the count assertion
    witnessed it at one too. The reduction this case states is the one the module
    docstring keeps stated at every count, and the chart this file is copied into next
    declares one.

    IT IS NOT THE BUILDER COMPARED WITH ITSELF, which is the objection those
    tripwires' own comment raises against `set(red_api_versions(...)) <= set(red.args)`.
    The INPUT here is hand-written and the EXPECTED VALUE is the module-level literal
    — neither is produced by the function under test. What it asserts is the reduction
    the module docstring states: at one check "every declared group except the one
    under test" is empty, so the whole red argv IS the filler.
