"""THE DATABASE INSTANCE THIS CHART CREATES, and what keeps it agreeing with the pod.

THIS CHART'S FIRST CONTENT ASSERTIONS. Until this file it was covered by `helm lint
--strict` alone, which reads syntax and asserts nothing about what renders.

WHAT MOVED AND WHY IT MOVED HERE. `yadgarhq/deploy`'s `infra/databases/task-db.yaml`
is a hand-written MariaDB CR under an Argo Application, so an adopter who installs
this chart gets the pod and no engine for it to talk to. ADR-0752 put the shared
platform layer in `yadgarhq/platform` and kept this object OUT of it, in one
sentence: "an object that exactly one module consumes does NOT go here. The three
MariaDB CRs belong to `iam-db`, `project-db` and `task-db` behind `database.create`."
This instance has exactly one consumer — the Deployment rendered beside it — and no
invariant spanning its siblings, so it belongs here.

THE TOGGLE DEFAULTS FALSE, and that is not a preference. `k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1`
is a CRD-backed group, so a chart that rendered this object by default would fail to
install on every cluster that has not adopted mariadb-operator — the same reason
`autoscaling.enabled` defaults false for its ScaledObject. The default render is
therefore asserted to be UNCHANGED by this whole change, against a literal count.

THE FALSE-GREEN THIS FILE IS WRITTEN AGAINST. The question "does this chart create
the engine the pod dials" has exactly one admissible haystack: the RENDERED OBJECTS.
Not a comment, not a values key read twice, not a substring of the rendered YAML —
a `yaml.dump(...)` substring search answers "the text `task-db-mariadb` appears
somewhere", which is true of the Deployment's own env var and of any comment, and
stays true after the CR's name is changed to something else entirely. So every
equality below reads ONE RENDERED OBJECT AGAINST ANOTHER: the MariaDB CR's own
fields against the values the Deployment's OWN container actually carries. Neither
side is read from `values.yaml`, so no edit to `values.yaml` can make both sides
agree while the install is broken — which is precisely the failure
`deploy/infra/databases/task-db.yaml`'s "THE NAMES ARE A CONTRACT WITH THE CONSUMER"
comment describes, where a wrong key mounts a Secret whose file the service cannot
find and the symptom is a connection error rather than a missing file.

EVERY GATE HERE ASSERTS THE COUNT OF WHAT IT EXAMINED. A gate that compares an empty
set of fields finds no disagreement among zero of them and reports a pass; the
comparison functions are PURE and return their failures plus the number of terms
compared, and each caller asserts that number against a literal written here.
